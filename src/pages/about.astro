		Hey! Welcome to the About page. I'm Pinapelz, a second-year Software Engineering student at the University of California, Irvine. 
		I'm a pretty avid <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VTuber">virtual youtuber (vtuber)</a> enjoyer so you may have seen me around or noticed a strange trend in the types of projects on my GitHub.
		Outside of that though I spend pretty much the remainder of my spare time programming random things or playing JRPGs/MMOs.
	</p>
	<h1>why this?</h1>
	<p>
		I thought it would probably be a good idea to have a place that documents some of my thought process since
		I have this fantastic habit of forgetting things, leaving braindead or no comments in my code, and generally just writing boilerplate
		Also it'd be nice to have a place where I can sort of archive my thoughts and ideas for future reference.
		<em>(plus I gotta work on my writing skills)</em>
	</p>
	<h1>what's this made with?</h1>
	<p>
		I was deliberating quite a bit about how I wanted to make the site. My web development experience is still fairly limited so I wasn't sure on what my options were.
		I ended up settling on using <a href="https://astro.build">Astro</a> since it seems like it integrates fairly well with different frameworks. I also like the idea of being able
		to write in markdown since it'll certainly make things easier on my fingers.
	</p>
	<h1>stuff</h1>
	<p>
		A lot of the things I've experimented with or made are on my GitHub and webpage down below. I plan to keep this blog pretty casual though.
