I've seen a lot of these "making gil without crafting" or "making gil with combat job" guides during my time with the game.
A lot of these videos and guides are fine, but in my opinion they neglect a lot of the late game and niche options that are available to players.

This post will attempt to be a somewhat comprehensive guide/info sheet to making gil without having to level any crafting jobs (cause I get it, crafting is not for everyone).

Keep in mind though that crafters are probably one of the most consistent methods of getting gil. There will be a lot more "instability" with these methods.
