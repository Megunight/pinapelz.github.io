I've seen a lot of these "making gil without crafting" or "making gil with combat job" guides during my time with the game.
A lot of these videos and guides are fine, but in my opinion they neglect a lot of the late game and niche options that are available to players.

This post will attempt to be a somewhat comprehensive guide/info sheet to making gil without having to level any crafting jobs (cause I get it, crafting is not for everyone).

Keep in mind though that crafters are probably one of the most consistent methods of getting gil. There will be a lot more "instability" with these methods.

# Grand Company Seals
You can rack up Grand Company seals (or GC Seals) fairly quickly by completing "Expert Deliveries". This is where you can
cash in on useless old gear or dungeon drops. You can usually get around `2000` seals per piece of "high level dungeon" gear.

Then you can spend these seals on certain items that are needed for crafting. In my opinion, most of these items net fairly low gil
but some commonly exchanged items are...
- Glamour Prisms
- Coke
- Potash
- Cordials


|As an example of how much these materials go for... | It's consistent but slow... |
|----------|----------|
| <FFXIVItemPrice client:load itemId={5530} itemName="Coke" /> | <FFXIVItemPrice client:load itemId={5501} itemName="Potash" itemImageUrl="https://xivapi.com/i/027000/027612_hr1.png" /> |

You can also try your luck by exchaning `20 000` seals for either a 3.0 or 4.0 `Materiel Coffer`. These drop random minions and
mounts from that particular expansion.

Don't get your hopes up so quick though. A very vast majority of the minions are basically worthless on the marketboard.
The actual rare mounts and minions have some serious Japanese gacha game drop rates...

Let's take the Night Pegasus Whistle as an example:
<FFXIVItemPrice client:load itemId={16564} itemName="Night Pegasus Whistle" itemImageUrl="https://xivapi.com/i/026000/026039_hr1.png"/>
> Based on the drop rate collected by the FFXIV Dalamud Plugin `Tracky`. 
> ### [This item has a drop rate of roughly 0.03%](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VfncSL5gf9E7ehgND5nZgguUyUAmZiAMbQllLKcoxTQ/edit?gid=1530436115#gid=1530436115)

The same story is true for all of the other rare mounts/minions. If you were to test your luck though I'd go for the 4.0 coffers since it beats
the 3.0 coffers in number of rare items which will give you a slight statistical edge.

- Overall: Very slow but a good way to get rid of old gear. Don't bother specifically farming dungeons specifically for gear to turn in since the gil comes very slow
